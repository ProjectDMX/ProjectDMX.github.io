Internal-state extraction is only useful in serving research if it does not
dominate the serving workload. We compared DMI with vLLM Hidden State Extraction
on Qwen3-4B prefill throughput using a single NVIDIA A100.

The short version: at larger batch sizes, DMI captures about **13x more tensor
data per token** than vLLM Hidden State Extraction while reducing extraction
overhead by about **15-17x**.

## Prefill Throughput

To compare extraction overhead directly, both runs exclude persistent storage
cost and measure prefill throughput while tensors are captured.

| Batch size | DMI overhead | vLLM Hidden State Extraction overhead |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | -14.0% | -20.4% |
| 4 | -10.7% | -34.9% |
| 8 | -6.9% | -40.1% |
| 16 | **-2.4%** | **-41.1%** |
| 32 | **-2.7%** | **-41.7%** |

At batch size 16, DMI's prefill overhead is **17.1x lower**. At batch size 32,
it is **15.4x lower**. In throughput terms, DMI reaches 23,995 prefill
tokens/sec at batch size 32, while vLLM Hidden State Extraction reaches 14,833
tokens/sec, a **1.62x throughput advantage**.

The gap is especially notable because DMI is capturing a much wider tensor
surface: residual streams, Q/K/V/Z, MLP tensors, layer-norm tensors, embeddings,
logits, and token IDs, compared with hidden states only.

## Takeaway

vLLM Hidden State Extraction is a useful hidden-state dumping path. DMI is
designed for broader observability with lower overhead in the serving path.

For research that needs a broader internal trace during vLLM inference, the
benchmark suggests DMI gives substantially more signal while keeping prefill
throughput much closer to the baseline.
